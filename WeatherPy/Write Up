After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modeling such as any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.

From the "Max Temp" linear equations, it is quite evident that the closer a city is to the equator, meaning latitude 0, the higher the max temperature. 
From the "Humidity" linear equation, there is no specific correlation between latitude and humidity, that is why the line of best fit is horizontal. This is the same 
case for the "Cloudiness" linear regression. There is almost no correlation between the city's latitude and the cloudiness.
